##Abstract

##Ingredients
500g sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
300g carrots, peeled and cut into chunks

100ml crème fraîche, plus extra to serve

##Method
Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/ gas 7 and put the sweet potatoes and carrots into a large roasting tin, drizzled with 2 tbsp olive oil and plenty of seasoning. Roast the veg in the oven for 25-30 mins or until caramelised and tender.

#RECIPE #2
Open ravioli with squash & porcini mushrooms
By Sara Buenfeld

##Recipe Information
Prep:40 mins
Cook:30 mins
Easy
Serves 2

##Abstract
Don't leave the vegetarians out this Christmas, with this special yet easy to manage recipe.

##Ingredients
450g butternut squash, peeled and chopped
25g butter
generous grating nutmeg
25g vegetarian parmesan -style cheese, coarsely grated

For the porcini dressing
1 tbsp finely chopped dried porcini mushrooms
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tsp balsamic vinegar
2 tsp soy sauce

To serve
generous pinch saffron
85g chestnut mushrooms, quartered
1 fat garlic clove, shredded
100g bag baby spinach
4 sheets fresh lasagne, halved
shavings of parmesan (or vegetarian alternative), optional

##Method
Put the squash and butter in a pan with 5 tbsp water. Tightly cover pan and cook for 15 mins until the squash is just tender, but not coloured. Roughly mash with seasoning, nutmeg and Parmesan.

Meanwhile, make the dressing. Put the chopped porcini in a small bowl with 3 tbsp boiling water. Cover with cling film and cook for 1 min in the microwave on High, then leave to cool. Mix 1 tbsp oil with the vinegar and soy, then add the soaked mushrooms with almost all of the liquid (leave the last drop behind as it might contain grit).

To serve, boil a pan of water with the saffron and some salt for 5 mins to extract some colour and flavour. Meanwhile, fry the mushrooms in the remaining oil. When they are nearly cooked, add the garlic so that it browns and crisps, but doesn’t burn. Pierce the bag of spinach and wilt in the microwave for 1 min. Reheat the squash in the microwave, too.

Boil the lasagne for 1 min until just tender, then drain. Put 3 little piles of spinach on 2 warm serving plates. Top each with a square of lasagne, then a spoonful of squash – spread it out a little, add a few spinach leaves, then top with another square of pasta. Continue these layers until you end up with a stack of 4 layers of pasta on each plate, then top each with a spoonful of squash. Scatter round the garlicky mushrooms, Prepare ahead

The squash can be mashed and the dressing made up to 2 days ahead; keep them both covered in the fridge. To serve, reheat the squash in a pan or in the microwave and take the dressing out to come to room temperature generously spoon over the dressing, or allow guest to help themselves at the table, and sprinkle over some Parmesan shavings, if you like.

#RECIPE #3
Gingerbread cake with caramel biscuit icing
By Cassie Best

##Recipe Information
Prep:1 hr, 20 mins
Cook:30 mins
Moderately easy
Serves 20

##Abstract
This sumptuous Christmas bake is covered in a decadent icing, finished with gingerbread biscuits and dusted with desiccated coconut 'snow'.

##Ingredients
150ml full-fat milk
3 tbsp black treacle
225ml vegetable oil, plus a little for greasing
375g plain flour
3 tsp baking powder
1½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
375g light brown soft sugar
1½ tsp ground cinnamon
1½ tsp ground ginger
3 good pinches of ground cloves
300ml buttermilk
3 large eggs
3 tbsp dark rum (optional – replace with extra milk, if you like)
1½ tsp vanilla extract

For the caramel biscuit icing
250g pack slightly salted butter, very soft
600g icing sugar, plus a little extra for dusting
300g full-fat cream cheese
2 tsp vanilla bean extract
200g smooth caramelised biscuit spread (I used Lotus Biscoff biscuit spread)
50g desiccated coconut, to decorate
silver edible glitter (optional)
gingerbread shapes (see tip)

##Method
Measure the milk and treacle into a saucepan (grease the measuring spoon with a little oil first and the treacle will easily slide off). Bring to a gentle simmer and stir until combined, then set aside to cool. Meanwhile, grease 3 x 20cm loose-bottomed cake tins with a little oil and line the bases with baking parchment (if you don’t have enough cake tins, see tip). If the tins are any shallower than 4cm, line the sides with a deep collar too. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

Measure the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, sugar and spices into a large bowl, then add 1/2 tsp fine salt. Mix the dry ingredients together with a large whisk; if there are any large lumps of sugar, squeeze these through your fingers until you have an even, sandy-textured mixture.

In a jug, whisk the oil, buttermilk, eggs, rum and vanilla. Add the milk and treacle mixture, and mix well. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry, and whisk into a smooth batter. Divide between the tins and bake for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cakes comes out clean. You may have to swap the cakes over to cook evenly, but don’t do this until they’ve had at least 20 mins cooking. Cool the cakes in their tins for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack, peel off the parchment and leave to cool completely. Once cooled, you can wrap the sponges in cling film and store in a cool place for 4 days, or freeze for up to 2 months – the texture and flavour will be all the better for it.

To make the icing, put the butter and half the icing sugar in a large bowl. Mash together roughly with a spatula, then whizz with an electric hand whisk until smooth. Add the remaining icing sugar, the cream cheese, vanilla bean extract and biscuit spread. Mix again until smooth and evenly mixed. Transfer half the icing to another bowl and set aside. Use the remaining icing to stack the cakes and cover the entire outside in a thin layer – don’t worry about making the cake look too neat at this stage, as any crumbs trapped in the icing will be covered in the final coat. Chill the cake for 30 mins and the remaining icing for 20 mins (remove the icing from the fridge 10 mins before the cake to soften a little).

When the icing on the cake is firm, remove it from the fridge and use the remaining icing to cover the cake. Smooth the sides using a palette knife, but leave peaks and dips on top for your snow scene. Top the cake generously with desiccated coconut, a dusting of sieved icing sugar and some edible glitter, if you like, then decorate the top and sides with gingerbread shapes (see tip). If you’re not eating the cake within a few hours, store it in the fridge, but bring back to room temperature before serving. Wlll keep for 2 days.
